Implementation code




# Export the model to a SavedModel
model.save('path_to_saved_model', save_format='tf')

# Recreate the exact same model
new_model = keras.models.load_model('path_to_saved_model')

# Check that the state is preserved
new_predictions = new_model.predict(x_test)
np.testing.assert_allclose(predictions, new_predictions, rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-6)

# Note that the optimizer state is preserved as well:
# you can resume training where you left off.
